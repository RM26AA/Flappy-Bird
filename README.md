# Flappy Bird - Java Game

**Flappy Bird** is a simple, fun, and addictive game implemented in Java. The objective of the game is to control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The game features smooth graphics, background music, and a main menu with play, help, and quit options.

## Features

- **Play Mode**: Click the "Play" button to start the game.
- **Gravity Mechanism**: The bird is affected by gravity and will fall unless you press the `Spacebar` to make it jump.
- **Pipes**: Pipes are generated at random intervals and the bird must fly through them without hitting them.
- **Score**: The score increases as the bird successfully passes through pipes.
- **Game Over Screen**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground. The final score is displayed, and you can restart by pressing `Spacebar`.
- **Background Music**: Background music plays during the game and can be controlled (start/stop).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Java 8** or later installed on your system. If you don't have Java installed, you can download and install it from the official [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-java.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd flappy-bird-java
    ```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, etc.).

4. Ensure the **`src/img/`** directory contains the images needed for the game (like `flappybirdbg.png`, `flappybird.png`, `toppipe.png`, `bottompipe.png`, and the banner image `banner1.png`).

5. Ensure the **`src/music/`** directory contains the background music file (`gta-4-music.wav`).

### Running the Game

1. **In your IDE**, run the `App` class, which will launch the main menu.
2. Click **Play** to start the game. Use the `Spacebar` to make the bird jump and avoid the pipes.
3. Press `Spacebar` after the game ends to restart.

### Controls
- **`Spacebar`**: Makes the bird jump and restart the game after it ends.
- **`Arrow keys`**: Not required for this game, only the `Spacebar` is used.

## Game Features

- **Main Menu**: Provides options to play the game, view instructions, or quit.
- **Help Screen**: Shows instructions on how to play the game.
- **Quit Option**: Asks for user confirmation before quitting the game.

## Background Music
The game includes background music that loops continuously while the game is running. It is stored as a `.wav` file, which is played using Javaâ€™s **Clip** class.
